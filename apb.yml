# Removed remote_user/key as well as OSC Service Acct and Token from parameters list.  APB will fail if
# these parameters are not available.  If they are added in the user entry area they will be available
# to the project via the apb_parameters secret.  However if they are only present in the opaque secret,
# they are only visible via the broker namespace, or within the running apb.
